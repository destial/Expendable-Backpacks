4. Use `/backpack` to access the interactive guide

### Requirements
- Minecraft Version: 1.21.1 or higher
- Server Software: Paper or Spigot
- Java Version: 21 or higher

---

## Usage

### Opening Backpacks
- **In Hand**: Right-click any backpack item in your inventory to access its contents
- **Placed Block**: Right-click a placed backpack block to open its inventory

### Placing Backpacks
- **Place**: Hold a backpack and **Shift + Right-click** on any surface to place it as a block
- **Break**: Mine the placed backpack to retrieve it with all contents intact
- **Protection**: Placed backpacks are immune to explosions, pistons, fire, and lava

### Viewing the Guide
Execute `/backpack` to open an interactive GUI displaying:
- All available backpack tiers and their specifications
- Crafting recipes with visual pattern representations
- Upgrade progression paths
- Enderpack functionality details

### Creating Your First Backpack
1. Craft a Leather Backpack using Leather, String, and a Chest (or receive one on first join if configured)
2. Right-click the backpack item to open its inventory
3. Store items as needed
4. Optionally place it in your base using Shift + Right-click
5. Upgrade to higher tiers by surrounding with appropriate materials

---

## Enderpack System

The Enderpack provides unique shared storage functionality:

- **Shared Storage**: All Enderpacks with identical UUIDs access the same inventory (items and placed blocks)
- **Cloneable**: Combine one Enderpack with one Ender Pearl to create two Enderpacks sharing the same UUID
- **Multiple Access Points**: Distribute cloned Enderpacks across different locations or players
- **Works When Placed**: Placed Enderpack blocks share the same inventory as their item counterparts
- **UUID-Based Identification**: Each Enderpack group identified by unique identifier

### Implementation Example
1. Craft an initial Enderpack
2. Clone the Enderpack by crafting it with an Ender Pearl (yields 2 Enderpacks with matching UUID)
3. Keep one in your inventory for on-the-go access
4. Place one as a block at your base using Shift + Right-click
5. Give one to a teammate or store in a chest
6. All instances with the same UUID access shared storage - even the placed block!

---

## Data Storage

Backpack data is persisted in `plugins/ExpendableBackpacks/backpacks.yml`:
- UUID-based identification for each backpack instance
- Automatic inventory serialization and saving
- Data persistence across server restarts and reloads
- Tab completion support for all registered backpack UUIDs

---

## Configuration

The plugin's configuration file is located at `plugins/ExpendableBackpacks/config.yml`.

### Available Options

```yaml
# Give a Leather Backpack to players when they first join the server
# Default: false
give-backpack-on-first-join: false

# Message sent to players when they receive their starter backpack
# Use & for color codes (e.g., &a for green, &6 for gold)
# Set to empty string ("") to disable the message
starter-backpack-message: "&7Welcome! You've been given a &7Leather Backpack &7to get started. Right-click to open!"
```

### Starter Backpack Feature

- Only triggers for players who have never joined before
- Adds the backpack to the player's inventory
- Drops the backpack at the player's location if inventory is full
- Sends a customizable welcome message with color code support
