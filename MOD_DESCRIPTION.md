## 📦 Placeable Backpacks

Backpacks can now be placed in the world as decorative blocks that retain full functionality!

### How It Works

*   **Place**: Hold a backpack and **Shift + Right-click** on any surface
*   **Open**: **Right-click** the placed backpack to access its inventory
*   **Break**: Mine the block to retrieve your backpack with all contents intact
*   **Protection**: Placed backpacks are fully protected from:
    *   Explosions (Creeper, TNT, etc.)
    *   Pistons (push/pull)
    *   Fire and lava damage
    *   Block explosions (Beds, Respawn Anchors)

### Use Cases

*   **Storage Rooms** - Create organized storage areas with visible backpack tiers
*   **Base Decoration** - Display your collection of high-tier backpacks
*   **Quick Access Points** - Place backpacks at strategic locations around your base
*   **Team Storage** - Place shared Enderpacks in communal areas
*   **Shops & Trade** - Create backpack displays in marketplace builds

### Important Notes

*   Placed backpacks retain their UUID - items stay exactly where they are
*   Breaking and replacing a backpack doesn't affect its contents
*   Enderpacks work the same when placed - all copies share the same inventory
*   You can still open backpacks in your hand with a normal right-click

## 🌌 Enderpack - The Special One

The Enderpack provides unique functionality not found in other tiers:

*   **Shared Storage** - All Enderpacks with the same UUID access identical inventory
*   **Cloneable** - Craft 1 Enderpack + 1 Ender Pearl = 2 Enderpacks with matching UUID
*   **Multiple Access Points** - Keep one in your inventory, one at your base, share with teammates
*   **Works When Placed** - Place Enderpacks as blocks and they still share the same inventory
*   **Perfect for Teams** - Coordinate shared storage across multiple players
*   **Cross-Location Access** - Access the same inventory from anywhere

### Example Use Case

1.  Craft an Enderpack
2.  Clone it by combining with an Ender Pearl (yields 2 Enderpacks, same UUID)
3.  Keep one in your inventory for on-the-go access
4.  **Place one as a block at your base for easy access**
5.  Give one to a teammate
6.  All three access the same 27-slot shared storage - even the placed one!
